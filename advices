first we must do the brute force

then try to decrease the complexity using the sorted array ( if it demands)

if not 
 
!! use the "use space" : either memorization ( DP ) or HashMap 
				because in the hash map all operations 
				are O(1)
so in this case ( in the case of use space ) we will make the space complexity
is 0(n)

but the interviewer will told you to make it constant space 
so here we must find the logic

also if we have arrays we can work with preprocessing 
like having an auxiliary array to use it
