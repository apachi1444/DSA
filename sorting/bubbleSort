comparing each two adjacent elements and then do the swap 

in nutshell , we will move in each iteration the last element to his right place
first iteration : we did n comparaison we get the max 
next iteration : we do n-1 because a sorted element already 

 4 3 7 1 5
 3 4 7 1 5
 3 4 1 7 5

 3 4 1 5 7 -- end of first iteration and start of second iteration
 
 3 1 4 5 7
 1 3 4 5 7
