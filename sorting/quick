complexity nlog n

its methodology is like having boys are going to take photos 

so the short one get front of tall ones

so we start from the beginning of the array

we choose randomly an element and we call it the "pivot"

we do two pointers i and j ( i from the beginning and j from the end )

i will stop if he will find an element bigger than the pivot
j will stop if he will find an element smaller than the pivot

4 6 2 5 7 9 1 3

pivot = 4

i = 4 j = 3

first -- i  = 6 > 4 will stop there
first -- j  = 3 < 4 will stop there

then swap a[i] with a[j]

4 3 2 5 7 9 1 6

second -------

i =  3 3 < 4 continue 
i = 2  2 < 4 continue

i = 5  5 > 4 break

j = 6  6 > 4 continue
j = 1  1 < 4 break

swap 1 with 5 

4 3 2 1 7 9 5 6



third -------------

i = 1 , then  7 break there
j = 5 then  9 then 7 then 1 break ( j < i ) swap j with pivot 

now pivot contains bigger elements in front of him smaller elements behind him

so we have 1 3 2  - 4  - 7 9 5 6
it's called partioning logic ( recursive calls )

now we should treat the left or right side of 4
