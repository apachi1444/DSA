it's a little bit optimized comparing to bubble but both n square in worst cases

so we divide our array into two arrays ( unsorted one , and sorted one )

so we take elements from the unsorted one and put them in the sorted one
until the unsorted get empty and the sorted get bigger

at first the sorted one contains the first element of the array
so the iteration in the unsorted array will start from the i = 1 NOT 0 

so we take our index i and then compare its element to the elements in the 
sorted one 

8 4 1 5 9 2

first sorted contains only 8 

i =1
 comparte 4 to 8 -> swap both elements 
	but we should put the element of unsorted array at index i 
	in a variable temp = unsorted[i]

so after swapping 4 with 8 
our sorted array will be 4 8 and the unsorted 1 5 9 2

now temp = 1

1 greater than 8 shift 8 WITH 1 
1 greater than 4 shift 4 WITH 1

sorted = 1 4 8 unsorted = 5 9 2 
temp = 5
shift 8 with 5 

etc .......
