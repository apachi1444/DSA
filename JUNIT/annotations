@Before

are functions that need to be run before each test 
like the setup ! or the ini();

@After
clear the list after the execution of each test !


@BeforeClass 
if we want to execute an expensive common operation before each test
it's so preferable to execute it only once before running all tests

RQ !!!!
@AfterClass and @BeforeClass must static functions !!!

@BeforeEach @BeforeAll ( JUNIT 5 )
eq
@Before     @BeforeClass ! ( JUNIT 4 )
