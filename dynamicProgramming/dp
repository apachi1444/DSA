the dp is based on subproblems which are dependant 
we have to store it somewhere to use it their value if we find the same subproblem again

!= different than the divide & conquer
each subproblem is independant

the greedy approach is we know every time the way we have to go on

result = 18 using three coins ( 1 , 5 7 ) 
complexity will be 3 ^ n without dp
with dp will be O ( m . n ) m : number of coins used

dp[n-a[i]] = numberOfCoinsUsed
