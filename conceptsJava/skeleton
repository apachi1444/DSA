it's an object that acts as gateway for the server side of object 

all the incoming requests are routed through it 

when he receives an incoming request from the client it does the following things :

- it reads the params from the remote object 
- it invokes the method on the actual remote object
- it writes and transmits ( marshals !! ) the result to the caller !
