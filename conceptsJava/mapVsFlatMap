map is used to produce single value of each input value
"One-To-One Mapping "!

map() takes Stream as Input and return Stream !


flatMap is used to produce multiple value for each input value 
"One-To-Mnay Mapping"

takes Stream<Stream<T>> as input and returns Stream<R>


example of map:
Stream.of("a","b") : transform data from lowercase to uppercase 

convert stream of stream into single stream
[[1,2] , [3,4]] => [1,2,3,4]


example of flatMap
List<String> phones = customers.stream().flatMap(customer -> customer.getPhones().stream())
				.collect(Collectors.toList());


// that s why we called it one to Many because a customer has too many numbers
