checked in the compile time 
for example : FileReader reader = new FileReader(fileName);

we have to make the function throws the Exception !

Exception

-> Error ( out of memory error , stackOverFlowError!  )
-> Exception 
	-> RunTimeException ( we have to catch them manually : NullPointerExcpetion , NumberFormatException! )
	-> Checked Exception (IOException) 


the finally bloc will always be executed !
