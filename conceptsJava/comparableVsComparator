using comparable interface 

a comparable object is able to compare himself to another object 
the class itself impelements the Comparable interface 
so -----
we implement the class compareTo() !!!!!!!!!!!



Comparator is external to the element type 
it's a separate class !
we create multiple comparators that implement Comparator 

---- so we must implement the compare() method !

then in the main
create an object of that comparator

Collections.sort(list, comparatorByName);
