the idea of working with distant objects 

we should first create its interface ! ( the user will call the interface ! )

interface extends Remote!

Remote Method Invocation 
( an API that provides a mechanism to create distributed applications in JAVA )

it allows an object to invoke method on an object running in another JVM :

the rmi provides communication between the applications using two objects 
( stub == client ) and skeleton ( server ) !

three layers 

stub/skeleton layer
remote ref layer
transport layer !

RMI uses the stub and skeleton objects for communicating with the remtoe objects 

remote object is an ojbet whose method can be invoked from another JVM


----------------------
stub ( client side )

it is an object acts as a gateway for the client side 
( all the ougoing requests are routed through it )
