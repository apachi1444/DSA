pass by value:  makes a copy of that value in memory 

pass by ref : makes a copy the address of that param, so modifying the param
will change the original value !

for primitive types we can think of passing by value
for references types java passes the reference by value !

creates a copy of the pointer to the object in memory!
so myCat for example = 0X12345
we will create a copy of that poiner i mean the adress of that object !
