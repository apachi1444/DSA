the server will first create the implementation object ( with creating of course the skeleton )

then he will post this object in the registry 
// to post this object into the registry
// use the Naming.rebind(name,obj);
name : rmi://localhost:1099/BK: bk name of the object !

we have to start the dictionnary ( the registry before the server ) !

we can either start the registry directly from the server main 
or we can start alone !

the client will first get the ref of the object from the registry

create his stub which will make the connexion with the skeleton !


Interface = Naming.lookup() // will return a remote object
// that's why we make our interface extends remote

it will return a stub then we must do a connextion with the skeleton 
--> then the client will do directly stub.nameMethodInInterface !


in the client part we should not rewrite the code of the server
but we should export the jar file of the server ( the interface and the business entity )
and insert it to the client project !
