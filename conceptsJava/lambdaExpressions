can only be used with only types of interfaces !

interfaces are like a contracts for classes that want to implement that interface !

lambdas allow us to pass only a specific implementation !

without creating a new class that impelement that method and 
loose too many lines of code !

it's like passing directly the specific implementation to the function 
that uses this interface !

without a creating a new object !

printThing(not an object that implements that interface but directly the implementation of that interface )


lambda are only used when we have functional interfaces ! ( one SAM ) !
