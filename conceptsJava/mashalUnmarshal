when a caller invokes method on the stub object 

- initiates a connection with JVM
- it writes and transmits ( marshal !! ) the params to the remote virtual machine 
  by passing this request to the remote Ref Layer ( RRL )! 
- it waits for the result ( the client side )
- it reads ( unmarshal ) the return value 
- it finally returns the value to the caller !
