we have to make scanner.close() when we finish using it !

scanner.nextLine() : will stop until the ser hits enter !

int age = scanner.nextIn(); // will wait until she gets the first while space!
even if we write something else after the number 
we can stock that thing in a String variable

int age = scanner.nextInt();
String name = scanner.nextLine();
