Queue is an abstract class using the FIFO strategy

we have to implement it using the linked list / array ...

the first poiner on the first element is "front"

the final pointer on the last element is "rear"



for the linked list :

enqueuing is adding an element in the queue of the list 
so will move the "rear" pointer to the new element

for dequeuing : remove element from the first position of the queue
aka removing the first pointer "front" to the next element !!



---------------------------------------------------------------

to check if the queue is empty or not we have to check if the front pointer is null or not !
