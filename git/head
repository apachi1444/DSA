the head points out to the last commit on the current branch

git show HEAD

When head doesn't point to most recent commit  , such state : 
is called detached Head
what do we mean by detached

when the head points on a commit ( when we do the git checkout hash of commit )
it means detached it's not pointing anymore on the feature directly

and when the head points on that commit we can do some modification

and when we points again on the feature these moidification 
done after that commit are called detached commits because no pointer
points on thme
