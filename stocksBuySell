we should find the min of the array and then max of the rest of array which satisfy the condition
of getting the max profit

buy ans sell stocks part 2 :

we can buy and sell as much as want stocks but if we already bought some stock
we have to sell it before purchasing another one 


---------
so here we must find the local min and local max each time 
and we compare the value of today with yesterday always 


--------------------------------------
int maxProfit ( array a ) {

	int profit = 0 
	for ( int i = 0   ; i < a.length ; i++){
		if (a[i] > a[i-1] ) {
			profit += a[i] - a[i-1]
		}
	}	

}
