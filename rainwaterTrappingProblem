we have an array of height of each building and we must find how many blocks
the water will be stored in

like 3 , 1 , 2 , 4 : so the response is 2 + 1 because we have two empty blocks
in the second building and one block in the third one

we must do the preprocessing !!!

left array and right array 

left : will calculate the max of each index i comparing with its left neighbor
right : will calculate the max of each index i comparing with its right neighbor

then the whole formula : 

i = Math.min(left[i] , right  [ i] ) - a[i]
