model ( red , green , refactor )

first write the test ( before creating the function )
----> will give you red 


write the function 
----> will give you green

pass a lot of time to reread the code , maintain the code etc ...
----> refactor!


SUT ( system under test !):
AAA structure !

arrange : tous les entrÃ©es 
act : execute the system with the inputs done by user and stock the outpuuts in vars
assert : verify outputs with the expected value
